CoinExchange - CoinBase Applicant Programming Exercise

Notes:

1.

I believe that there was a pair of contradictory statements in the email describing this exercise:

"The GDAX API exposes an endpoint to retrieve the current order book for each currency pair. For this task, you should use the level 2 query parameter to fetch aggregated order information."


"The application should be a client-side application that does not depend on a server. All API requests, form processing, and result display should be done client side in the mobile app."

It wasn't quite clear to me whether I was to access GDAX over the network, or whether to "not depend on a server" and do everything client-side.

The latter meant that I would have to use a dummy orderbook table, which, I decided, would  take me longer to create by hand, and vary, than just go ahead and get from GDAX over the network.


2.

I have the app access the orderbooks once every 15 seconds.  During testing, I noticed that GDAX would sometimes return a "Rate limit exceeded".  I presume that this is not an issue with my code, and could be due to the 15 second queries.
